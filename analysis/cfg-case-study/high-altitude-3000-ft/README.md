# High-Altitude Case Studies (3000 ft)

This directory contains detailed simulation results for the high-altitude
(3000 ft) case studies presented in the AIAA SciTech 2026 paper  
**“Autonomous Battery Units as an Enabling Technology for Urban Air Mobility.”**

The simulations were conducted for three eVTOL aircraft:
- Archer Midnight  
- Joby S4  
- Supernal S-A2  

Each aircraft was evaluated at a cruise altitude of 3000 ft and for three
mission ranges:
- 30 miles  
- 45 miles  
- 60 miles  

The results in this directory include detailed outputs for all simulated cases
and are intended to support the summarized figures and tables presented in the
paper.

## Notes

For corresponding low-altitude (1500 ft) results, see the
`low-altitude-1500-ft` directory.  
A high-level comparison and aggregated results are provided in the
`result-summary` directory.
