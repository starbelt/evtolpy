# Result Summary

This directory contains the summarized simulation results presented in the
AIAA SciTech 2026 paper  
**“Autonomous Battery Units as an Enabling Technology for Urban Air Mobility.”**

The results in this directory provide high-level comparisons and aggregated
metrics across all evaluated eVTOL aircraft, mission ranges, and cruise
altitudes. Detailed, case-by-case results can be found in the
`low-altitude-1500-ft` and `high-altitude-3000-ft` directories.
