# Case Study Simulation Results

This directory contains simulation results for the AIAA SciTech 2026 paper  
**“Autonomous Battery Units as an Enabling Technology for Urban Air Mobility.”**

The simulations were conducted for three eVTOL aircraft:
- Archer Midnight  
- Joby S4  
- Supernal S-A2  

Each aircraft was evaluated at two cruise altitudes (1500 ft and 3000 ft) and
three mission ranges (30, 45, and 60 miles).
